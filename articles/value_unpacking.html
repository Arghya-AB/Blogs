                Multiple assignment or <u><b>unpacking</b></u> is one of python's features to assign values to multiple variables in a single statement.
                It's counterpart, <u><b>packing</b></u> is collecting multiple values to store in a single variable (often a list or tuple). 
                They are particularly useful to make the code concise, more readable and elegant. This article is on one of them, that is, <b>unpacking</b>!
                I also have an article on unpacking in python here. Python allows combining unpacking and packing 
                at the same time to form a really powerful feature which will be covered in the unpacking article.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are extremely useful and often unexplored features of python. In this article, we will deepdive into python's unpacking and implement a custom class which supports unpacking!
            </p>
            <p>
                These features can be used in various ways including assignment in for loops, swapping and destructuring.
                Moreover, python supports this for any iterable (it's consistent üòÑ)! This makes integrating the features in custom types easy and useful 
                for the API user. Chances are, you may already have implemented it for your classes.

            <header>Basic unpacking for tuples</header>
            <p>
                The most basic unpacking operation (and also the most common) in python will be standard tuple unpacking.
                In fact, historically, python <i>only</i> supported tuple unpacking. It's a really useful feature
                as we will explore soon! 
            </p>
<pre><code class="lanaguage-python-repl">>>> some_tuple = (1, 2, 3) # assign a tuple reference to some_tuple
>>> # suppose we want to store the elements in some_tuple in seperate identifiers!
>>> a, b, c = some_tuple # tuple unpacking! 
</code></pre>
            <p>
                This can have really varied usecases! The most common one being swapping variables values in python. 
                Tuples can be declared without providing the parenthesis in python. This is encouraged when the usecase
                is clear or makes the statement more readable.
            </p>
<pre><code class="lanaguage-python-repl">>>> some_tuple = 1, 2, 3 # this is still a tuple
</code></pre>
            <p>
                We can swap variable values with this neat trick, just create a tuple with the old values of the variables and 
                assign them with tuple unpacking. (Note that this works as long as length of tuple is same as number of variables)
            </p>
<pre><code class="lanaguage-python-repl">>>> a, b = 10, 11 # assigning 10 and 11 to a and b üòâ
>>> a
10
>>> b
11
>>> # now we need to swap a and b
>>> some_tuple = a, b
>>> b, a = some_tuple # the values of a and b are now swapped!
>>> a
11
>>> b
10
>>> # but we can do better
>>> # just declare the tuple in the same line and assign!
>>> a, b = b, a
>>> # `b, a` declares the tuple with value (b, a) in the same line.
>>> # this will swap the values again and looks so much cleaner!
>>> a
10
>>> b
11

        <header>Some advanced unpacking</header>
        <p>
            Turns out, unpacking isn't just for tuples! It works for any iterable (lists, sets, tuples, generators and even custom ones).
            This can be very useful since this means that it can also support functions <code>map</code> without needing
            any other conversion. In fact, it's one of my preferred ways of taking input which need to be typecasted in CP.
        </p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">>>> a, b, c = [1, 2, 3] # works on list because it's an iterable!
>>> print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
>>> a, b, c = (i*i for i in (a, b, c)) # let's try a generator
>>> print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}") # works
a = 1, b = 4, c = 9
>>> # it works similarly for dicts and sets too, try them!
>>> # here's one of my preferred ways of parsing space seperated floats as input
>>> # I'll provide a few random inputs to demonstrate
>>> a, b, c = map(float, input().split()) 
2.33 4.72 7.27
>>> # the code looks elegant and works!
>>> print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, type = {type(a)}")
a = 2.33, b = 4.72, c = 7.27, type = &#60;class 'float'&#62;
</code></pre>
    <p>
        Turns out we can even use this while looping for parallel assignment. This makes iterating through <code>zip</code>ped
        or enumerated iterables really easy and concise.
    </p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">>>> x1, x2 = ["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]
>>> for name, value in zip(x1, x2): # iterating over a zipped iterable!
...    print(name, value)
...
a 1
b 2
c 3
>>> # zip actually yields a tuple of the zipped elements
>>> # we can use python's multiple assignment to access the elements parrallely
>>> # in the first iteration, it's the same as `name, value = ("a", 1)`
>>> # this assigns "a" to name and 1 to value!
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Another powerful feature of unpacking is that it accepts nesting of iterables!
        </p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">>>> (a, (b, (c, d, e))) = [1, (3, {True, "Hello", 3.4})]
>>> # works (even for multiple types of iterables and types)!
>>> print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, d = {d}, e = {e}")
a = 1, b = 3, c = True, d = 3.4, e = Hello
>>> x1, x2 = ["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]
>>> for (idx, (name, value)) in enumerate(zip(x1, x2)):
...     print(idx, name, value)
... 
0 a 1
1 b 2
2 c 3
>>> # this can be really useful in loops like this!

        <header>Writing a class which can be unpacked</header>
        <p>
            This is really easy, the object just needs to be an iterable with limited number of elements to support unpacking!
            So this is just writing a simple iterable class üòõ
        </p>
        <p>
            Here we will write a simple unpackable class which can be unpacked to a bunch of 1s. The number of values allowed
            will be specified during instance creation.
        </p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">>>> class Unpackable:
...    def __init__(self, number): 
...        self.count = number
...    def __iter__(self): 
...        return (1 for _ in range(self.count))
...
>>> x, y = Unpackable(2)
>>> print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
x = 1, y = 1
>>> # lets try iterable count more or less than number of variables
>>> x, y = Unpackable(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&#60pyshell&#62", line 1, in &#60module&#62
    x, y = Unpackable(5)
ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
>>> # python shows an error because there were too many values in the iterable üëÄ
>>> x, y = Unpackable(1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&#60pyshell&#62", line 1, in &#60module&#62
    x, y = Unpackable(1)
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
>>> # it's an error again üëÄ
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Python will automatically raise an error if there are too few or many values to unpack! You can get around this
            by analyzing the python bytecode but that would make it CPython specific so I'm not going into details here. Check
            <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16481156/find-out-into-how-many-values-a-return-value-will-be-unpacked">this.</a> It
            could also change with the future releases of python (especially because of the major bytecode changes from 3.11+) so I don't
            recommend using it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We just wrote a custom class which supports unpacking! That's it for unpacking in python for the most part
            but there's something more! You can even combine packing and unpacking in python for some powerful features. Check
            out my unpacking article <a href = "value_packing.html">here</a> for more details.
