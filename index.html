            Hi there! Nice to meet you, I am Arghya (AKA DarkDragon), a student and developer and this is where I write my own blogs.
            Just a random fun loving person on the internet who loves exploring!

            <header>The website 💻</header>
            This website theme will remain consistent across all the pages. I love minimal websites which load fast, are resource efficient
            and focus more on the content (as you may have noticed, no images unless required in content 😜). The style sheet 
            is fairly minimal too while supporting both light and dark theme and staying responsive. The only javascript used in this website is from highlight.js which I 
            use for syntax highlighting in code blocks (if any). This ensures that the website loads fast and barely takes any runtime resources.

            <header>Preferred programming languages and OS 🐍</header>
            I have worked with <b>Python</b>, <b>Rust</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b> and <b>Kotlin</b> programming languages. I am always curious and want to learn more about the amazing world of
            technology. Although I daily drive windows, I have used multiple linux distros* (including Debian, Bedrock, Garuda, Arch and spinoffs, Ubuntu, Solus and Mint) 
            and love the customizability provided by linux.<br><br>
            <small>*Yes, my linux experience was wild and fun!</small>
